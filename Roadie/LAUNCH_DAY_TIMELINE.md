2. **"Every backer counts."** 10 excited backers is better than 100 lukewarm ones.

3. **"Respond with gratitude."** Every comment is someone taking time to engage.

4. **"This is just Day 1."** You have 29 more days to build momentum.

5. **"I built something people want."** You already proved that with beta testers.

6. **"I'm allowed to take breaks."** Burnout helps no one. Rest when needed.

7. **"Comparison is the thief of joy."** Your journey is unique. Stay in your lane.

8. **"I've got this."** You built the app. You can launch it.
